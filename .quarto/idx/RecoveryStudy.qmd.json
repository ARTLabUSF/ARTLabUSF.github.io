Participants will then receive 12 weeks of treatment provided by the psychological services center, complete biweekly phone follow-ups after treatment cessation, and attend follow-up sessions at different time points over the next few of years. We will be tracking these individuals and trying to collect data on those that continue to seek treatment or maintain sobriety for the duration of this study.\n\n# Payment\nAs a part of this study, you will receive:\n\n**$955-$1,455** in compensation.<br></br>\n**12 weeks FREE** of therapy.\n\n\n\n# FAQs\n- **Where will the therapy sessions occur?**<br></br>\nThe therapy sessions will occur at the USF Psychological Services Center, located at 3711 USF Citrus Drive, Tampa, FL 33620.\n\n- **What is the time commitment?**<br></br>\nThe time commitment is 12 weeks of therapy, with 1 session per week.
