# Overview
The recovery study is designed to better understand the ways in which individuals recover from alcohol use disorders, as well as what the word recovery means in the context of alcohol use disorder. Participants will then receive 12 weeks of treatment provided by the psychological services center, complete biweekly phone follow-ups after treatment cessation, and attend follow-up sessions at different time points over the next few of years. We will be tracking these individuals and trying to collect data on those that continue to seek treatment or maintain sobriety for the duration of this study.
