Please click the link below to learn more!\n\n\nThe Recovery Study is our most current study that can be read about here: Recovery Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization of the Ambivalence Model\n\n\nIn this NIAAA funded program of research we are examining the incremental and predictive validity of measuring craving experiences as the concurrent activation of both approach (desires to use) and avoidance inclinations (desires to not use). Utilizing both clinical trial and daily process methodology, this study will examine the dynamic longitudinal relationships between daily approach and avoidance inclinations and drinking behaviors in those diagnosed with alcohol use disorders prior to (30-day pretreatment interval), during (30-day treatment interval), and after receiving a brief alcohol intervention (30-day post-treatment interval). In addition, the study will examine how these processes change over the course of recovery, including their influence on treatment initiation and treatment retention.\n\n\n\nIn this research program, we are conducting secondary analyses of numerous treatment outcome datasets to examine the influence of pretreatment changes in drinking behavior on mechanisms of change research. Preliminary data on pretreatment change suggests that approximately 50% of those seeking treatment for alcohol dependence rapidly decrease their drinking before beginning treatment and then maintain such changes throughout treatment. Such findings challenge the assumption that “major changes” begin only after treatment entry and suggest that “treatment” is only part of a process that begins weeks or months prior to treatment entry, significantly impacting the study of mechanisms of change.s"

The study will recruit participants seeking AUD treatment and assess their alcohol use and behaviors. Participants will receive 12 weeks of therapy and be evaluated regularly for up to 54 months post-treatment. The findings aim to enhance understanding of recovery dynamics, improve clinical decision-making, and inform future research on AUD treatment.\n\n\nPayment\nAs a part of this study, you will receive:\n$955-$1,455 in compensation. 12 weeks FREE of therapy.\n\n\nFAQs\n\nWhere will the therapy sessions occur? The therapy sessions will occur at the USF Psychological Services Center, located at 3711 USF Citrus Drive, Tampa, FL 33620.\nWhat is the time commitment? The time commitment is 12 weeks of therapy, with 1 session per week. Each session will last approximately 1 hour. After this, you will have to attend 90 minute appointments every 3-6 months for up to 54 months."

Specifically, I am interested in applying multidisciplinary approaches to the study of: a) processes associated with positive treatment outcomes, with a particular emphasis on craving and pretreatment change, b) risk factors for the development of substance use disorders (SUDs), including positive and negative reinforcement pathways to use, c) the interplay between substance use, comorbid disorders, personality, and aggression, including intimate partner violence, and d) the moderating role of individual difference variables in alcohol related disinhibited behaviors. Related to my work on craving, I am also interested (in collaboration with Dr. Diana Rancourt) in the applicability of craving as a transdiagnostic construct for disordered eating and compensatory behaviors. Secondary interests include methodological issues in clinical science broadly, and substance use research specifically.\n\nGoogle Scholar"
