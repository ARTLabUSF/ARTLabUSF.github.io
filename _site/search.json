Participants will then receive 12 weeks of treatment provided by the psychological services center, complete biweekly phone follow-ups after treatment cessation, and attend follow-up sessions at different time points over the next few of years. We will be tracking these individuals and trying to collect data on those that continue to seek treatment or maintain sobriety for the duration of this study."

Utilizing both clinical trial and daily process methodology, this study will examine the dynamic longitudinal relationships between daily approach and avoidance inclinations and drinking behaviors in those diagnosed with alcohol use disorders prior to (30-day pretreatment interval), during (30-day treatment interval), and after receiving a brief alcohol intervention (30-day post-treatment interval). In addition, the study will examine how these processes change over the course of recovery, including their influence on treatment initiation and treatment retention."

Preliminary data on pretreatment change suggests that approximately 50% of those seeking treatment for alcohol dependence rapidly decrease their drinking before beginning treatment and then maintain such changes throughout treatment. Such findings challenge the assumption that “major changes” begin only after treatment entry and suggest that “treatment” is only part of a process that begins weeks or months prior to treatment entry, significantly impacting the study of mechanisms of change.s"

Applying multidisciplinary approaches to the study of processes associated with positive treatment outcomes, with a particular emphasis on craving and pretreatment change. 2. Risk factors for the development of substance use disorders (SUDs), including positive and negative reinforcement pathways to use. 3. The interplay between substance use, comorbid disorders, personality, and aggression, including intimate partner violence. 4. And the moderating role of individual difference variables in alcohol-related disinhibited behaviors.  Related to my work on craving, I am also interested (in collaboration with Dr. Diana Rancourt) in the applicability of craving as a transdiagnostic construct for disordered eating and compensatory behaviors. Secondary interests include methodological issues in clinical science broadly and substance use research specifically.\n\nGoogle Scholar"
